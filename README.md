> A modern and clean interface for managing recipes and ingredients, In Meal acts as a digital cookbook without bloat.

## 🍇 Features

<p align="center">
    **This is still a work in progress but currently supports simple recipe and ingredient management.**
</p>

_Designed to be responsive with tablets in mind from the start. No more squinting at small buttons or "mouse-friendly" UX 🪤._

-   Minimal design avoids bloating your experience with unnecessary reviews or comments 😁.
-   Bulk editing for ingredients, no more typos across all your recipes 🔏!
-   Searchable, recipes and ingredients are easy to find 🔎.
-   Batteries included meta-data, easily include common meta-data for recipes such as servings or cook-time 🔋.

## Quick Start

Serve the development configuration locally,

```sh
npx nx run serve-stack
```

This runs a Vite dev server for the frontend and a dotnet API.

-   Vite is configured with HMR and auto-restart
-   dotnet is configured to watch and auto-restart too

## Project overview

| Project                                      | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [InMeal](./apps/InMeal.Api/README.md)        | A dotnet API using EF Core + MariaDb                                     |
| [Food UI (aka. "FUI")](./apps/fui/README.md) | A Vite + React UI built with Carbon Design System and heavy modification |

## Building for Production

> Ensure you have a valid MariaDb/MySQL instance you can connect to before continuing.

Configure your environment with a db connection string in a fresh dotenv file,

```sh
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

To get the app up and running we simply need to build and run the docker images using Docker compose,

```sh
docker compose up
```

Done 🎈! You should be viewing successful docker container logs in your console.
Visit the app on <http://localhost:3002/>

> Note: nx docker-build will determine you need to build the dotnet projects.
> nx-dotnet has issues when running in parallel, as it and msbuild conflict on file-locks...
> To avoid this problem, the underlying script builds the dotnet projects sequentially before
> building the containers.
