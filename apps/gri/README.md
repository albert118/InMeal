> A simple REST Microservice abstracting the consumption of a generative model for images of a recipe.
> This provides stylistic representations of the recipe prompt and implements some prod-ready features.

## ðŸ¤– Features

**This is still a work in progress but currently supports simple recipe and ingredient management.**

> The main goal of this project is providing an easy to deploy, maintain, and consumable model.
> The model aims to provide consistently styled results, so that they are themed. These are also stylistic,
> and not a pure representation of the real recipe.

-   **Safe**: Filtered prompts and tailoured outputs to avoid extranous uses...
-   **Documentation**: OpenAPI standard and code-first design.
-   **Fast**: uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for a fast development + build + deploy time.

## Getting started

// TODO: this is all tweaked after importing to the monorepo

To run the app in development mode,

```sh
source ./bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then checkout the OpenAPI docs, [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs].

## Build the Docker image

To build the service using Docker compose run,

```sh
docker compose up
```

or to build without compose,

```sh
docker build -t testImage .
docker run -d --name testContainer -p 80:80 testImage
```

test it by visiting the [ping-pong test URL](http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/ping)
