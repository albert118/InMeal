# Meal UI (Frontend for InMeal)

This project runs and manages the frontend incl. associated dependencies.

* The frontend project watches files using *React*
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

All the usual so far,

#### `npm start`
#### `npm test`

#### `npm run build`

## Startup (First Time)

Install the dependencies, run the app tests, then spin-up the app.

```

npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Building / Compiling the Production App

This builds the project into the `frontend\build` directory. It bundles everything up at once (incl. minify, file-hashes, etc.)

```
npm run build
```
